7zn30i pubg stutter..ok i would love to keep playing pubg but it has hit the point i am almost unable to play without getting a stutter every 11.5 seconds irrelevant of where i am or what is happening. shadowplay off  just turned death cam and replay on  it stutters again while havin 80 100 fps looking over military yeah i still have these turned off. whats your gpu  970gtx  frames sit fine though during the stuttering. same  its so frustrating. 7f9pu0 a game i used to run smoothly on 1080p two weeks ago has unplayable frame lag on lowest possible settings..im guessing its a memory leak issue as i only have 8gbs of ram and it seems like the memory leaks ive dealt with in other games.any help   and i haven t see anyone else describing the magnitude of fps loss as yours  what gpu do you have  i ve had issues with nvidia drivers but it was quickly fixed by updating.   my fps hasn t changed in a long time and i play everyday. this sounds like a personal computer problem  not the game.  i would try rolling back to previous previous video drivers and if that does nothing  a fresh install of windows will fix it for sure. if so   we would like to encourage you to report these issues directly to bluehole using whichever of the following links is the most appropriate     server lag reports       bug reports      because this subreddit is fan run there is unfortunately not much we can do here regarding either server issues or in game bugs.","infogive":" 7kl95f i finally fixed my performance issue gtx 1080..after months of trying everything i could i dig into my bios setttings and forced all 4 cores to be active at all times was set to auto and made sure xmp was on it wasnt. really wish i figured this out 2 years ago when i built this thing   i have a gtx 1070 8gb with an intel i7 4770k and have been getting great fps even on the official servers for months now because i knew what the hell i was doing with my hardware. especially since i got the cpu for  180 from microcenter back when i got it. i have 16gb of ram running at 1333 and i get 50 100 fps  usually around 60 80 from my gtx 1070 gb. ive definitely had xmp enabled before  and i most have accidentally turned it off a couple months ago when i was changing some settings. then i went into the memory settings and turned on xmp. 7hhren surprisingly good fps with my new 3440x1440 monitor.. i average around 5060 fps which i thought never would happen. anyone else using a similar setup that can share their experiences   i want a 1440hz monitor too  o upgraded to a 1440p monitor and when i switched in game from 1080p to 1440 i got better frames  yeah lol strange. i play 1440p with gtx 1080 and the only time i drop to 60 is if im in yas. i can t wait for 1.0  i run the  non oc  4790  and a gtx 1070 with a 1440hz monitor.  am i correct in assuming that means i m gpu bound  my 4790k loves this game for some reason. thanks for the explanation  and thanks for the downvotes other people on the subreddit     gpu is apparently 103  according to hwmonitor lol   i have a 1080ti and a 6700k and play at 1440p.","inforeq":" 7mz4pv what are the optimal nvidia cp settings for best fps now. .

changes to my settings.  i only un re installed my gpu driver yesterday  i might try reinstalling the whole game if it doesnt get better. my cpu is overclocked to 3.5ghz   ram set at 1866  from 1600   and gtx 1070 overclocked about 5 .   it s a long shot  but you re exactly describing an issue i solved just yesterday after having it for weeks. do a speed test on the ssd  samsung has a tool   if it is below 400mbs then it is starting to get pretty low. 7tf9k7 anyone notice stuttering recently pc.. i have a ryzen 5 1600 with 16gb of 3200mhz ram and an amd rx480 4gb. the game has played very smoothly  for me up until now so im wondering if a new update has caused an increase in gpu vram usage has anyone else had a similar issue thanks for reading   you and i have the same set up except i have a 470 8gig  i upgraded two days ago and only now the stutter starts  maybe a ryzen 5 1600 issue   other games run totally fine  its just pubg.  i have a higher average fps after the new update. that being said  it shouldn t use 8gb   once the vram has been completely used up  it starts to stutter badly for me      i ve toned the game down to medium and still getting stuttering  grrrr is vsync on  every since 1.0 ive been getting stutters when i get shot at making it impossible to win gun fights. check your gpu vram usage  mine s maxed out since the last update   same stuttering issue. it started happening to me after the last update  it stutters every few seconds or when something happens like  someone shooting or car stopping  after the stutter end it goes back to the normal fps around  120  fps  tried verifying the game cache   reinstalling my gpu driver   lowering settings and nothing worked.","suggestion":" 7dkksq new amd driver 17.11.2 helps with stabilizing

theyre not behind cover.. does everyone want to bend the bullet or be john wick .is there are genuine reason for it or is it some douchey streamer mechanic that apparently everyone has copied or am i slow on the uptake help me obiwan kenobi   also you confuse the enemies about head shot  people will shot directly at middle   while you lean to the side making them miss every single potential headshot   and if u time it right  once they understood they need to shoot to the left  or right  you lean to the other side making it even harder to hs you most shooters fire at center mass  and let the recoil move up for a possible headshot. if you are the target  and lean left and right  it moves your head hitbox so it s not straight up from center mass. even if the players don t know why they re doing it  it doesn t make it not the best option. idiots watch a streamer do it and feel cool copying it but there s a tactical advantage to do it.   basically  it s letting you change positions to avoid hits without sacrificing accuracy. 7jv51c ads vs hip fire  free aim..when do you guys use one versus the other  i am still trying to figure out what the best option is but given the current state of the game engine free aim seems to be the better option in all situations unless the target is standing still.what do you guys think  do you use ads in close  urban type engagements  i find that hipfire  holding rmb to be clear  is better in close quarters  like inside buildings or generally close range. hipfiring indeed reduces recoil and does not reduce degree of control to the point where it matters. not just because you can see where you re shooting clearer  but because your bullets are more accurate that way.  on longer ranges  it is of course better to ads.  you need to distinguish between pure hip fire and holding rmb hipfire.","ohter":" 824t1w this should be the new 7.62 rifle..worth noting that mexico has used it for decadesmiramar being in mexico and as such it could be a miramar specific weapon since erangel has the dp28 in 7.62 or it could simply be a world spawn at the rate of for instance the mini and sks.ingame it should imo either be 1 shot and 3 shot burst ala m16 or 1 shot and full auto with huge vertical recoil for balancing purposes. it could have a muzzle slot scope slot and foregrip slot   i think they should change the scar l to a scar h and have it fire 7.62 nato and move the aug from the crate to a world spawn.  there just isn t enough difference between the scar and the m4 to justify them both  and the aug  while good  isn t worthy of being a crate weapon.  you have the three 5.56 guns    the m16 for stability  the m4 for high firerate and the scar somewhere inbetween  depending on your skill and taste.  add to that the sks and mini and you have enough guns for different situations. it beats most guns in cqb and it s low recoil makes it better than the sks  m16  and mini at range. 7oiwvg the akm is worse in every way  do we want that.. the m416 has way less recoil and is the best ar for spraying2 the m416 is less susceptible to air drag speculation. i realize many like the m416 and some even obsess or fetishize over weapons irl strengths where i imagine modern western weapons are better but this is a game and i think viability should span all weapons regardless of era or associated popculture like ww2 eastern cold war vietnam modern scifi or whatever   don t you want the weapons you like to be as viable as others  the faster the bullets are the more succeptible they are to air drag  so the m416 is more harshly affected by drag compared to ak. the ak has way higher recoil than the m4 and either lower dps  if we can believe the new data mined values   or such minimally higher dps than the m4  that its high recoil is in no way justified. in most cases  the slightly lower time to kill on the ak was so negligible that server tickrate and ping played a higher role in the outcome of a fight than the ttk of the ars.  again  all ars should be different but equally strong so that it comes down to preference and playstyle. i main the akm  but do much better with the m416 just because it s a op lazer

with feature called loudness equalization. these increase quiet sounds and lower loud sounds   you can turn em up until you get distortion   the main problem with loudness equalization in pubg is that it distorts positional audio. redzone makes my ears cry even if volume is at 1 cause they have it coded to be the loudest thing in the game.  have you tried using graphic equaliser instead of compression please note that this will make it harder to tell the distance to gun shots you hear. if it is too loud  you are doing something wrong its an issue not game breaking but still an issue yeah they just need to not care about hearing footsteps as much. loudness equalization helps  but its nowhere near solving the problem. 80kx8x there should be no reason why the plane is still this loud.. but there is no reason why it should still be this volume.in this game sound is extremely important even being able to hear the slightest sound of a single footsteps can decide whether you win or lose the game  currently players who have a loud volume to try and hear footsteps have to either suffer from the immense sounds  that could cause real life ear damage  or mute their volume  which further puts them at a disadvantage in the game. i think it is intended that the plane is a lot louder than cars  and that the sound from planes  massively contrasts  the sound of footsteps. however the red zone appears to have been nerfed as it is super quiet now and you can easily hear footsteps above the sound of explosions. i can t hear shit in game either if plane is flying above and i am fine with it like i said in the post  i understand it is meant to be realistic  but in mine and many other people s opinions  it is better to have something that is enjoyable instead of something that is ultra realistic. you just have to turn down your volume a bit if you think it is too loud.","inforeq":" 7fdzc6 can we get a sound effect for when teammates enter vehicles..itd be awesome to be able to hear a little sound queue even just a shuffling noise or a door closing when your squad enters your vehicle. i know you can see the icon but looking top left is super annoying  i like it when ppl are able to pull that off  why make it harder for such ppl  i think there should be car entering and leaving animations  like opening the doors  getting in and closing it. also would be cool if you jump out of a moving vehicle and do some kind of a roll  lots of possibilities  but i ll guess we ll have to wait and see. i d love to see someone bail out of a car and literally land on their face in a heap. not just the squad  should be a general thing yup   i d go even further and say that a proper animation would be a good thing too. at the moment there is absolutely no sounds or animations for entering or exiting cars right   we gta now boys tbh  id rather see them actually fix the game and make it more optimised than add door sounds and animations to the game. 7qcj3d why do we have the zone do more damage the further you are outside it. . i know it was to counter an esports game where someone camped outside the zone to get in top 3 or whatever but no one ever uses this tactic in normal gameplay and its so stupid my friend is about a metre ahead and gets to the point where the zone does less damage but i die despite the tiny distance difference just because im not in the same part of death circle    maybe 5 6 circles eat armor too to stop this  when the hell have you actually seen it used properly in your games though playing outside the circle shouldn t be encouraged  but i do agree that the first circle is much too aggressive i was under the impression that the damage difference depending on distance from the zone didn t start until like the 4th circle. hunger games esque i think itd add in a little more panic  furthermore  why do we have the zone dealing enough damage to kill you within seconds while it s still big enough that you need to run multiple hundred meters   why is the thing meant for corralling often actually more dangerous than people   not only that  but it also completely discourages any kind of fights because you re only fucking yourself over.  so  you were probably in the blue when a later circle finished collapsing and the damage increased. i killed him  but at that point i didn t have enough time to get to the circle in time and died to the zone. they load up on first aid kits while hiding in cover just  outside the blue for like 3 4 minutes  until no one thinks to check the blue and then they slip in behind everyone.","ohter":" 81wshb a different take on the redzone..2. this is why the single best gameplay suggestion i have heard for this game is that one person on each plane has their parachute replaced with an anvil because thats how this game style works and it is hilarious   there s already a blue zone to screw you over when the game wants you dead  i dont need another one ok i get the game is already random enough but your just like fuck it  how be we make even worse and keep the red zone. one example is to reduce the red zone sound  so the game is actually enjoyable  but also reduce footsteps with it. i understand that the redzone is meant to mask footsteps  but their are other ways to go around it than producing such levels of volume. if you want to be sure not to die in the red zone  just circle around it i say  yeah and get killed by a  running in the open trying to circle around b  blue zone pushing at the same time c  the team you were in a fight with . if you reduce both  people will just turn their volume up even more  they already removed fog and rain. 8114vf if were keeping the red zones can we at least change how they work..1. not my ideal solution but it would at least bring us back to how we used to treat the red zones way back in the beginning where everybody was actually afraid to be out in the open with them  standing in it would slowly hurt you like being outside the play area and or make your eyes water so things get blurry if you re in the smoke. it accomplishes what i feel was the original intent  forcing people out of areas and to adapt to the situation. if you have the full mask  you don t have either effect on you but visibility is still somewhat reduced by the smoke fog effect itself. have some utility items that help with it  like making the gas masks non cosmetic items that prevent damage and or blindness.  it also could make the gas mask useful  i wouldn t make it prevent all damage though  your submission in  r

circles end on those areas more often  i feel like the circle doesn t rotate to many places around the map that would be interesting.  and it s because most of the time you can loot them for quite a while and still get to the circle unless you get completely screwed on car spawns or circle location  since driving across erangel isn t complete bs. the much easier driving on erangel also means that it s more viable to drop on a vehicle and drive off somewhere on the outskirts to loot  while on miramar if you do that and the circle doesn t favor you re basically just screwed.    its the exact

lack of loot  but the positive part is that you have to learn to play in miramar  d  sorry for bad english  or ill not play this game at all until im not forced to play an awful map just because the devs want me to i spent 80  of the time running around the map .  as the patch notes tells you   added a new map   miramar  miramar will temporarily have a higher chance of being selected  so after a x amount of miserable sadness about not getting to play the  original  map  they will change hte map selection    and in my gaming time  its more like 10  of matchings that you ll get to play erangel. how many games have you actually played on it  you just must not be paying attention because theres tons of hot drops with great loot. new map is shoved down your throat and if you want to play the map you actually bought the game to play  tough luck it has like a 20  chance at most of happening. i wouldn t mind if the rubber banding wasn t the literal worst. 7mtwpz what are some good places in miramar where looting does not entail opening 1000 doors besides el pozo..i really really really hate the new buildings and how many doors need to be opened. i like el pozo but what else is there   there is also another building that offers more loot but has a lot of doors. if you like fighting that is.   for high action pecado and hacienda del patron are great and don t have too many buildings with high door density  the caves south of los leones i ve always gotten consistent loot from the water treatment plant. two open churches and a cemetery like area that doesn t require opening doors. water treatment and power plant     don t recall the name on the map i hate power grid 95  of the time because half of the time the loot isnt worth it and once you loot the 4 buildings then you have to haul ass to any other location without getting chomped by the circle  power grid i think you re thinking of."},"5":{"bug":" 7pkbt9 na matchmaking not working. . removed  same  just playing on asia servers for now. region locking commence  2.0 update. bluehole does not know de wae. read before posting  servers will be offline for 4 hours today. same here same here yeah  the same thing is happening to me now. 7ba9gr comms not working duo  squad. . removed    was working fine last night  pretty frustrating. yeah stopped it working for me as well interesting enough yesterday this patch was on test server so if breaking comms wasn t on purpose then they are fucking retards. same  no comms same  my comms aren t working either.  do you know whats funny voicechat bug noobies   i have this ever since i bought the game on 3rd of september   sent a ticket to en masse they send me to forums made 15 threads nobody cares made some threads about it here  same except for a bonus i got called an  entitled retard  apparently  whining after not being able to have proper gameplay for 2 months is not ok but it is okay to whine about severs being defaulted to asia   devs are clueless about it and my threads keep getting  or ignored. nice just nice  it is connected to vivox being garbage their sht keeps bugging for me only in 2 out of 10 games it works else i hear nothing only devs vivox can fix this  this isnt your problem.","infogive":" 7w9zbz how useless is reporting team killing..so i got team killed by a random person reported it with video evidence i was streaming they replied they would investigate and closed the ticket two days later.op  i have over 250 tk in last 3 4 months i guess i was reported in at least 150 never got a warning  usually hackers and ppl who cant be quiet in voice chat  couple of  they fired first to loot me    some friends  definitely reported me . when we land in team if anyone of us gets killed i kill the enemy then my teammates so we leave and play again  one of my friends is really salty and he rages if he gets tk by me so he reports me happened at least 50 60 times. ive been unconcerned enough with it to kill a few random team mates when they are obviously hacking . i ve tkd maybe 5 times  hackers  other potential tkers  squads of 3 that mark somewhere to try and get me killed then drop somewhere else  never gotten a ban.  necessary evil  i mean look at how horrible they are with anti cheat  they obviously just see this game as a cash cow and don t give any real fucks about anything but money. 7nlv15 i never face a hacker these guys just accuse people because they are bad they probably arent hacking  first game today as well as 22 games last week were killed by people that move and aim like this  got proof for all . . removed  and if they don t believe  fuck them.         if you feel this post was removed in error unfairly  please feel free to either respond to this message or send a  modmail    great you got proof  now to figure out how to report them i have. when an event occurs that sparks a wide range of interest and thoughts of players we encourage you to express your opinions on the subject  but we ask you not to do this in a new thread and to instead submit it as a comment to an already publicised post on the topic. there have already been countless videos posted here showing them hacking.  got proof for all   dude come on  everybody knows there are hackers.","inforeq":" 7sakn2 at what point does china just get regionlocked. . removed  not sure what time that is for china.   until then it makes financial sense for bluehole to let the chinese hackers do what they want  as they spend the most at the game. although there are cheaters everywhere  it would be silly to pretend that at this moment in this game china is not the big problem.  the only meaningful ping limit is one which says if your ping is above the average for the region where the server is then you cannot join that server.  i don t see bluehole doing anything that would jeopardize the profitability of their game in china  profit appears to be more important that the quality of the game. 7lsdaw so did bluehole just remove erangle completely. . removed          if you feel this post was removed in error unfairly  please feel free to either respond to this message or send a  modmail    in the last 20 games i ve only played erangel. there s a higher chance to get miramar  its in the patch notes i believe   but i think you ve just gotten really unlucky.  we will also remove topics which duplicate a recent post  such as multiple posts of the same stream highlight or news item . i still have yet to play on miramar you seem to have the opposite problem a lot of other players are having lmao i call bs what region and mode . so far for me  it seems like a 2   1 ratio  but as with all probabilities  ymmv.","ohter":" 7yxd0q the tiered pinglock system bluehole just announced will work better than a region lock if implemented properly.. however. although a ban may go into effect vpns are not illegal in china meaning getting around an ipbased region lock would be as easy as downloading a free vpn client or paying for a cheap highquality vpn and coming back to us servers  even though we all may be put with higher ping people unfortunately  the goal is to reduce the number of cheaters you will encounter  unless you are in relatively high ping   so it should all even out why would you want to lock ping  he s a pretty cool guy. why someone who live far from any servers  i got 100  to eu  140  to as  should play with 200 300  players  i understand that majority of players have nice ping to regional servers  but some don t  why should we suffer  you are fine  to play against someone with ping advantage  but as soon as you play against someone with an advantage on you  you are   suffering . this isn t talking about putting random squads duos together   it s talking about the servers  as in people with between x y ping will be in one server  while people with a b ping will be in another server. if they ll give you players who are massively off your ranking to fill a lobby now  they are going to give you high ping chinese players.    ping is a chinese name ping lock is region lock therefore xenophobic  s the issue is that their matchmaking system has always placed getting a match quickly over anything else. 7ow6da commonly suggested cheatprevention methods and pros and cons..g. cons innocent falsepositives will be thrown into the shadow pool without knowing it and have no way to determine whether they are shadow banned. players with many games under their belt that have never been banned players can queue to watch replayskill cams of suspected cheaters and other reported players. good method.ip ban  there are usually enough people that come to the reddit with false proof of cheats as it is  usually related to some spectate bug . i m not a huge fan of esea  and wouldn t really mind bluehole having dedicated servers for people that would want to play with a more invasive anti cheat.  hardware ip bans would kill gaming cafe s and such  and they are super popular in asia. people that share the same ip  students at college  would all be banned. i m sure players with half his skill in pubg would get banned as well.","suggestion":" 7dqby9 this game needs ping locks
